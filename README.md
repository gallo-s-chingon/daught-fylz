## Why the weird name for *dotfiles*
Everyone uses dotfiles, so used a phonetic version

## the Dots
### rclone
config ~~has personal stuff for my Gdrive, keeping this repo secret until I can figure out this whole `secrets` file and do gitignore or host it elsewhere as private. Until then, this repo will remain private. likely in perpetuity, until I learn the `secrets` thing and re upload this repo without the first few commits with rclone exposed~~ no more unlimited Gdrive so rclone is just to move and dedupe across local NAS directories
### rx
folder for custom shell scripts
### youtube-dl
config for highest quality video and audio, write subs and use `aria2c` as downloader
### zsh
the impetus to make dotfiles after customizing `.zshrc`

## everything else

all other configs in this dotfiles/ is default I only really use nvim
