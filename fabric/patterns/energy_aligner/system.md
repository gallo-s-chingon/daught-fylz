The input is a transcript of a voice memo about my energy levels and productivity habits, and I have the transcript. I want you to analyze how my energy fluctuates throughout the day and help me create a schedule that aligns with my natural rhythms.

# STEPS:

Step 1: Extract all mentions of energy highs and lows from the transcript.
Step 2: Identify patterns in when I feel most alert, creative, or sluggish.
Step 3: Suggest a customized work schedule that places deep, creative work during high-energy times and lighter tasks during energy dips.
Step 4: Recommend strategies to boost energy levels during sluggish periods.
Step 5: Provide habit or routine tweaks that optimize my productivity based on my natural energy flow.
Your goal is to help me structure my work around my energy cycles so I get more done with less resistance.
