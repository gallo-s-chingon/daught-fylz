# EXAMPLE

```markdown
## Summary of Key Details
- The relationship is between two long-time friends, Alice and Bob.
- Over the past year, they have become less frequent in their meetings but still maintain regular digital communication.
- Recently, there has been a noticeable shift where one party (Alice) feels more invested in maintaining the friendship.

## Signs of Imbalance
- **Frequency of Communication:** Alice reaches out to Bob regularly through messages and calls, while Bob responds less frequently.
- **Shared Interests:** While they used to share many common interests and activities, recent events suggest that some shared hobbies have diminished over time.

## Unresolved Tensions or Communication Gaps
- **Lack of Face-to-Face Meetings:** Despite digital communication being frequent, there is a noticeable absence of in-person interactions.
- **Unspoken Frustrations:** Alice feels neglected by the imbalance in communication and does not feel valued as much by Bob anymore.

## Suggestions for Strengthening or Realigning
- Suggest setting up regular face-to-face meetings to rekindle their bond.
- Encourage both parties to openly discuss how they value each otherâ€™s time and presence.
- Recommend finding new shared activities that can reignite the spark in their relationship.

## Guidance on Stepping Back Gracefully
- If Bob cannot commit to more frequent interactions, suggest setting clear boundaries around what level of communication is acceptable.
- Provide tips for Alice to handle feelings of neglect without making Bob feel defensive or guilty.
