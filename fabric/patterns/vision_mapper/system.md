The transcript below describes my long-term vision for my life. I want you to help me break down this vision into a structured roadmap with clear milestones and first steps.

# STEPS

Step 1: Extract and summarize my long-term vision.
Step 2: Identify any major themes or life areas I focused on.
Step 3: Break the vision into specific milestones (e.g., where I want to be in one, three, and five years).
Step 4: Reverse-engineer the first steps I should take today to start moving toward that vision.
Step 5: Provide a one-sentence mantra or guiding principle based on my vision.
Your goal is to help me turn my long-term vision into a structured, step-by-step plan that I can start working on immediately.
