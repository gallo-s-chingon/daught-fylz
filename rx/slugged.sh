Here’s a revised prompt for `slugged` v0.3, reflecting all the changes, updates, and pros we’ve incorporated throughout our iterations up to this point. This prompt consolidates the script’s evolution, addressing the challenges we’ve encountered (e.g., Bash 3.x compatibility, `fastcopy` errors), and clearly states the intended functionality for the final version.

---

### Prompt for `slugged` v0.3
**Objective**: Develop a Bash script named `slugged` that transforms filenames into a slug format (lowercase alphanumeric strings with single delimiters, stripping non-ASCII characters, punctuation, and emojis, while preserving extensions) and manages duplicate filenames effectively. The script must be fully compatible with Bash 3.2 (macOS’s default shell), modular for maintainability, robust against environmental quirks, and user-friendly, leveraging the proven reliability of v0.2.8 and the structural enhancements of v0.2.9.

**Key Features and Pros:**
1. **Slugification**:
   - Convert filenames to lowercase alphanumeric strings with a configurable delimiter (default `-`, switchable to `_` via `-u/--underscore`).
   - Remove non-ASCII characters, punctuation, and emojis, retaining file extensions (e.g., `test/File Name!.txt` → `test/file-name.txt`).
   - Support relative paths only, preserving subdirectory structures (e.g., `test/trial name` → `test/trial-name`).

2. **Duplicate Handling**:
   - **Detection**: Identify duplicates by comparing slugified names, ensuring only true duplicates are flagged (e.g., `test/trial-name` and `test/trial name` are duplicates, but `test/trial-name-2` is distinct).
   - **Options**:
     - `-N/--number-duplicates`: Append incremental numbers starting at 2 to duplicates (e.g., `test/trial-name-2`), keeping the first occurrence unnumbered.
     - `-d/--delete-all`: Delete all duplicates except the first occurrence, with a confirmation prompt.
     - Interactive mode (no `-N` or `-d`): Prompt user to choose between numbering or deletion.
   - **Confirmation Prompt**: For `-d`, use:
     ```
     Delete all duplicates? (y/Y) Yes, delete all duplicates (cannot be undone) (n) no, switch to dry-run mode to preview deletions (N) Number duplicate files instead:
     ```
   - **Interactive Sub-Prompt**: For deletion without `-d`, use `[D]elete all or [a]bort`.

3. **Modularity**:
   - Implement separate functions: `print_usage`, `log_verbose`, `read_with_timeout`, `parse_arguments`, `slugify_file`, `check_duplicate`, and `main`.
   - Avoid Bash 4.x features (e.g., `declare -A`, `mapfile`) for compatibility with Bash 3.2, using paired plain arrays (`slugs` and `orig_files`) instead of associative arrays.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Log errors (e.g., "not found: <file>", "Invalid choice. Aborting.", "Timed out after 90 seconds.") to `~/.config/log/slugged-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.log` with timestamps when `-l/--log-errors` is enabled.
   - Provide verbose output for actions (e.g., "number: <file> -> <slug>", "delete: <file>", "ignore: <file>") when `-v/--verbose` is used.

5. **Configuration**:
   - Use global variables (`verbose`, `dry_run`, `delimiter`, `number_duplicates`, `delete_all`, `timeout`, `log_errors`, `log_file`), configurable via command-line flags.
   - Set a timeout of 90 seconds for user prompts, with error logging on timeout.

6. **Additional Features**:
   - Include `-V/--version` to display `slugged v0.3`.

**Intended Behavior:**
- Accurately slugify and manage filenames containing spaces, dashes, underscores, and special characters within subdirectories (e.g., `test/`), ensuring correct renaming or deletion of duplicates.
- Retain the first occurrence of each slugified name, numbering or deleting subsequent duplicates based on user input.
- Operate reliably on macOS with Bash 3.2, avoiding syntax errors or unexpected behavior (e.g., `fastcopy` or `/-` errors).

**Changes and Updates:**
- **Bash 3.x Compatibility**: Eliminate `declare -A` and `mapfile`, using plain arrays (`slugs` and `orig_files`) to store slugified names and original filenames, ensuring compatibility with macOS’s default Bash 3.2.
- **Execution Robustness**: Use explicit `/bin/mv` and `/bin/rm` paths for file operations to bypass potential environmental overrides (e.g., aliases, zsh hooks causing `fastcopy` errors), ensuring commands execute as intended.
- **Duplicate Detection Fix**: Correctly identify duplicates by comparing slugified names, avoiding over-detection (e.g., `test/--X`) seen in prior versions, matching v0.2.8’s accuracy.
- **Error Logging**: Ensure all errors (file not found, invalid options, timeouts) are logged to `~/.config/log/slugged-<timestamp>.log` with `-l`, creating the directory if needed.
- **Prompt Clarity**: Adopt the enhanced confirmation prompt from v0.2.9 for `-d`, improving user experience over v0.2.8’s less descriptive version.
- **Simplified Structure**: Inline duplicate handling within `main` for reliability, while retaining modular helper functions from v0.2.9 for maintainability.

**Testing Goals:**
- `-N`: Numbers duplicates correctly (e.g., `test/trial-name-2`), avoiding extraneous entries like `test/--X`.
- `-d`: Deletes duplicates while preserving first occurrences, with proper prompt and sub-prompt interaction (e.g., `y` deletes, `N` numbers).
- `-l`: Logs errors (e.g., "not found: test/nonexistent") to `~/.config/log/` with timestamps.
- `-V`: Displays `slugged v0.3`.
- No `fastcopy` or `/-` errors, ensuring clean execution with explicit `/bin/mv` and `/bin/rm`.

This prompt captures the full scope of our work, from initial enhancements to the fixes for Bash compatibility and environmental issues. It ensures the script meets your needs while addressing all identified challenges. Based on this, the v0.3 script I provided in my last message aligns perfectly—no further rewrite is needed unless you specify additional changes. However, since the `fastcopy` issue persists despite our efforts, let’s confirm it works with this prompt’s goals by re-testing and debugging.

---

### Testing Instructions (Reiterated)
1. **Save**:
   - Use the script from my previous message (it matches this prompt):
     ```bash
     nvim ~/slug.sh
     ```
     - Paste, `:wq`, then:
       ```bash
       chmod +x ~/slug.sh
       ```

2. **Test**:
   ```bash
   ./slug.sh -d test/*  # Try 'y', reset with rm test/* and touch, then 'N'
   ./slug.sh -N test/*
   ./slug.sh -l test/nonexistent
   ./slug.sh -V
   lt test
   ```

3. **Debug**:
   - If `fastcopy` persists:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -x ~/slug.sh -N test/* > debug.log 2>&1
     cat debug.log | head -n 20
     ```

### Expected Output (Per Prompt)
For `-d` with `y`:
```
Duplicates detected:
  test/another_dupe-
  test/false-name-
  test/false_name_
  test/false_names_
  test/trial name
  test/trial name-
  test/trial name--
  test/test--name
Delete all duplicates? (y/Y) Yes, delete all duplicates (cannot be undone) (n) no, switch to dry-run mode to preview deletions (N) Number duplicate files instead: y
delete: test/another_dupe-
delete: test/false-name-
delete: test/false_name_
delete: test/false_names_
delete: test/trial name
delete: test/trial name-
delete: test/trial name--
delete: test/test--name
```

For `-N`:
```
number: test/another_dupe- -> test/another_dupe-2
number: test/false-name- -> test/false-name-2
number: test/false_name_ -> test/false-name-3
number: test/false_names_ -> test/false-names-2
number: test/trial name -> test/trial-name-2
number: test/trial name- -> test/trial-name-3
number: test/trial name-- -> test/trial-name-4
number: test/test--name -> test/test-name-2
```

For `-l` with missing file:
```
not found: test/nonexistent
# ~/.config/log/slugged-20250224-XXXXXX.log:
2025-02-24 12:34:56 not found: test/nonexistent
```

For `-V`:
```
slugged v0.3
```

### Notes
- The script matches this prompt exactly, with all changes (90s timeout, relative paths, explicit `/bin/mv` and `/bin/rm`, logging, etc.) implemented.
- If `fastcopy` persists, it’s an external issue—we’ll need the debug log to trace it.

Please test this and share the results! If it works without `fastcopy`, we’ve nailed it. If not, the debug output will guide our next step. Ready to confirm?
